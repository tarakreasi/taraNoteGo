Welcome to **TaraNote**, your personal **Digital Garden**.

 ---

## Getting Started

### 1. The Workspace (Private)
Access the private workspace at `/taraNote` (or just `/`).
- **Notebooks:** Create folders on the left sidebar to organize your thoughts (e.g., "Drafts", "Ideas", "Projects").
- **Pages:** Create notes inside notebooks.
- **Editor:** Use the rich text editor to write. Changes are **auto-saved** every 2 seconds.

### 2. The Digital Garden (Public)
Your public site lives at `/articles` and `/portfolio`.
- **Draft Status:** Notes created in the workspace are `DRAFT` by default (Private).
- **Publishing:** To share a note, open it and toggle the status to `PUBLISHED` in the top right corner. It will instantly appear on your public site.
 
 ### 3. Cultivating Content (Maturity Levels)
 One of the key features of a Digital Garden is "Maturity". You don't have to wait for perfection to publish.
 
 - **Seedling**: Early ideas, rough notes. Good for getting thoughts out.
 - **Budding**: Developing concepts, partially complete. Good for feedback.
 - **Evergreen**: Polished, timeless content. Your best work.
 
 Use the **Status Dropdown** in the editor to signal to your readers what stage the article is in. This builds trust and encourages "learning in public".

 ### 4. Managing Content (Delete)
 To keep your garden prune, you may need to delete notes.
 1.  Hover over the note in the **Left Sidebar List**.
 2.  Click the **Delete Icon** (trash can) next to the note title.
 3.  The button will change to a red **DEL?** confirmation button.
 4.  Click **DEL?** to confirm. The note is deleted immediately without any browser popups.



## Customizing Your Site

Go to **Side Menu > Settings** (Gear Icon) to customize your identity.

### My Profile
