# UI Version 3.0 (OneNote Style)

**Codename:** "Purple Clone"
**Date:** Mid-October 2025
**Status:** Deprecated

## Overview
To solve the navigation issues of V2, we swung to the other extreme: copying the industry standard. V3 attempted to replicate the Microsoft OneNote interface pixel-for-pixel using web technologies.

## Key Features
-   **Three-Column Layout:** The classic Notebooks -> Sections -> Pages hierarchy.
-   **Horizontal Tabs:** "Sections" were displayed as horizontal tabs across the top.
-   **Branding:** Heavy use of `#7719AA` (OneNote Purple).

## The Pivot Point
This version was technically successful but strategically flawed.
1.  **Identity Crisis:** It looked like a Microsoft product, not a "Tri Wantoro" portfolio project.
2.  **Licensing:** Concerns arose about using proprietary icons and trade dress.
3.  **Feel:** It felt "corporate" and stiff, lacking the "Digital Garden" vibe we wanted to cultivate.

**Outcome:** Abandoned in favor of V4 (TaraKreasi Identity).
