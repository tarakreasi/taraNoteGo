# UI Version 1.0 (Legacy)

**Codename:** "Bootstrap Era"
**Date:** September 2025
**Status:** Archived

## Overview
This was the initial "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) interface. The focus was entirely on backend functionality (CRUD operations), so the UI was built using standard utility classes without a cohesive system.

## Design Traits
-   **Structure:** Basic top navbar and container layout.
-   **Typography:** Browser default sans-serif.
-   **Colors:** Default blue link colors, gray backgrounds.
-   **Metaphor:** Standard "Web 2.0" CRUD application.

## Retrospective
While functional, V1 lacked any personality or brand identity. It was sufficient for testing API endpoints but failed as a portfolio piece.
