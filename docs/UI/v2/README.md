# UI Version 2.0 (Bento Grid)

**Codename:** "The Grid"
**Date:** Early October 2025
**Status:** Archived

## Overview
V2 saw the first attempt to introduce a unique layout. Inspired by modern portfolio trends, we experimented with a "Bento Grid" layout for the dashboard.

## Design Changes
-   **Grids:** Moved away from list views to grid-based card layouts.
-   **Dark Mode:** First rough implementation of dark mode using CSS variables.
-   **Cards:** Introduced the concept of "Notebook Cards" with hover effects.

## Why We Moved On
The Bento Grid was visually interesting but confusing for a note-taking app. Users (and myself) found it hard to navigate deep hierarchies of notes using just a flat grid. We needed a nested structure.
