# UI Version 4.0 (TaraKreasi MVP)

**Codename:** "The Pivot"
**Date:** November 2025
**Status:** Superseded by V6

## Overview
V4 was the birth of the project's true identity. Abandoning the Microsoft clone look, we established the "TaraKreasi" brand guidelines: Blue/Orange palette, Inter typography, and a focus on clean, open-source aesthetic.

## Major Shifts
-   **Palette:** Replaced Purple with Electric Blue (`#4485EE`) and Sunset Orange (`#FF5F1F`).
-   **Navigation:** Replaced horizontal tabs with a modern sidebar and "Floating Dock".
-   **Typography:** Adopted `Inter` for all UI text.

## Legacy
V4 laid the groundwork for V6. While V6 added "glass" and "ambience", V4 defined the *skeleton* and *color theory* that we still use today.

## Prototypes (Time Capsule)
These are historical artifacts preserved for reference. They are standalone HTML files.
