# Colophon: Crafted with Love

**TaraNote** is more than just code. It is a symphony of human creativity, machine intelligence, and the most precious resource of all: time.

This project was built standing on the shoulders of giants, both silicon and silicon-valley-based.

## The True Investment

Beyond the lines of code and the commits, the most significant component of TaraNote is **Time**.

*   Time spent understanding.
*   Time spent refining.
*   Time spent iterating from "Electric Earth" to "Zen Glass".
*   Time spent crafting details that most will never notice, but everyone will feel.

**TaraNote** is a snapshot of this time - preserved, structured, and shared.
