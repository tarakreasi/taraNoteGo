# Design Lab & Research

**Status:** Foundational | **Focus:** Aesthetic Theory

## Overview
The `research/` folder captures the theoretical work that underpins the V6 "Electric Earth" design system. Before writing a single line of CSS, we analyzed trends, defined color theories, and established the "feeling" of the interface.

## Core Findings

### 1. [Research Findings (RESEARCH.md)](./RESEARCH.md)
**The foundational document for V6.**
It details the shift from flat design to "Liquid Glass" and "Minimalism 3.0".
-   **Concept:** "Technological Nature"
-   **Color Theory:** Why we chose \#FF5F1F (Orange) as the primary action color.
-   **Layout Strategy:** The move to Bento Grids and Floating Docks.

## Methodology
We use an iterative research process:
1.  **Observe:** Analyze trends (e.g., Linear, Cron, Apple).
2.  **Synthesis:** Combine elements to create a unique identity ("TaraKreasi").
3.  **Define:** Codify these into Tokens (See [../../DESIGN_TOKENS.md](../../DESIGN_TOKENS.md)).
