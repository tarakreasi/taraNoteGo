# Product Requirements Document - V4.0 (The Pivot)

**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Version:** 4.0 (MVP for Public Release)  
**Status:** Superseded by V6

## 1. The Pivot
We are abandoning the "OneNote Clone" direction (V3) due to licensing concerns and aesthetic limitations. V4 introduces "TaraKreasi" - a unique brand identity that merges productivity with a personal portfolio.

## 2. Core Concepts
-   **TaraNote:** The private workspace (formerly V3 features).
-   **Digital Garden:** A new public-facing blog engine.

## 3. Design System V4
-   **Palette:** Electric Blue (#4485EE) & Sunset Orange (#FF5F1F).
-   **Identity:** Modern, Clean, Open Source.
-   **Typography:** Inter (Google Fonts).

## 4. Feature Requirements
-   **Public Portfolio:**
    -   `/articles` index page.
    -   Public article view with "Read" focus.
-   **Content Status:** 
    -   Add "Published" status to notes.
    -   Only Published notes appear in the Garden.

## 5. Roadmap Adjustments
-   Focus shifts from "Desktop Simulation" to "Web Portfolio".
-   Priority: SEO and Public View performance.
